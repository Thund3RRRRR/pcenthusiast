                There are two types of storage, SSDs, and HDDs. The general difference 
                between the two is that the SSDs are more expensive for less storage, but
                that storage loads extremely quickly. And the HDD is the opposite, giving 
                more storage for a cheap price, but at the cost of slow speeds. This might 
                make it sound like it’s completely pointless to buy an SSD, but there are 
                reasons to, which will be explained later on.

                A HDD, or hard drive, is where most of your data will be stored. This is
                because we always have a lot of photos, documents, files, and more that we
                want kept in one place, and the HDD is the place for that. This is because 
                we can get a lot of storage for a lower amount of money, and we don’t care 
                how long it takes to load up these files. We aren’t accessing these files 
                multiple times a day on our computer. We just want them stored. So waiting 
                an extra 30 seconds or so to bring them up isn’t of much concern. Usually,
                people get a 2tb hard drive, because it’s so much space for such a low cost. 
                But you can always get more down the line.

                An SSD is where we typically want to put the applications that we want to be
                loaded quickly, because we access them so often. The most common being the 
                operating system. Every time you go to start up your computer, the computer 
                needs to start up the operating system that the computer uses (which is almost
                always Windows). This is a complicated process! And we’re always turning our 
                computer on and off. So we want to make sure that when we boot up our computer, 
                it doesn’t take a long time to turn on. The same goes for certain applications 
                that you use frequently, such as an editing software, or a game, or pretty much 
                anything you use multiple times a day that you don’t want to waste time waiting 
                for it to load. The amount you get is up to you, and your budget. The least 
                amount is usually 128 gigabytes, which is enough to store the operating system, 
                and a few other extra applications. You could go upwards from there, but keep 
                in mind that the price goes up with it.
