            <p>Think of the CPU as the brain of your computer. It holds the instructions
            for your computer, and lets it know what to do and when to do it. The more powerful
            the CPU, the more efficiently the computer will run. In the world of CPUs, there are 2
            brands that you want to consider, each of which provide great processors that
            shine in their own categories.</p>

                allowing the computer to run multiple tasks like video editors, or anything to do with content
                creation at a very efficient speed.

                If you don't really care about visual appearance, and you have an AMD CPU,
                you're in luck, becuase you barely have to worry about cooling. Most AMD CPUs come
                with their own stock cooler which is designed to nicely regulate the temperature of your CPU.
                Keep in mind that as the generations progress, AMD could refrain from putting 
                coolers in their CPU packages, in which case you can order a stock cooler for anywhere
                between 20 and 80 dollars, depending on how colorful you want it to be. One more thing
                to make sure of when buying a cooler is that it's compatable with your CPU and motherboard,
                because not all of them are, while others require manual adjustment to fit the correct
                type.

                If you do care about appearance, and you have the budget to put a nice touch
                of lighting into your PC, then you may want to consider water cooling. This method
                is significantly more effective when cooling your components, looks nice, and allows for temperature
                adjustment, but that doesn't mean that it's important. Standard fans and a stock cooler will get the job done just fine. Some things to
                consider when purchasing a water cooler (often called an AIO) is not only the price,
                but the installation process, which is almost always more complicated than the usual stock cooler.

                    the CPU has its graphics intigration capabilities removed. The T means that the CPU was
                    made especially for efficient desktop computing. The S means that the CPU is a special edition.
