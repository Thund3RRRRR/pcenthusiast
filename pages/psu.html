            The Power Supply
        </h1>

                Every single electronic device needs power. Your PC is no different. However, getting 
                power to your computer is a little more complicated than just plugging one thing into the wall, 
                and then bam, you’re done. Because a computer like this is a little more complex than a standard 
                desktop, you need one power source that goes into the wall, that then redistributes it all throughout 
                every part of the computer. The component that does this is called the power supply, or PSU. 

                <br>

                When you buy a power supply, each one comes with a set of cables for each component. However, 
                what sets different forms of PSUs apart is how those cables are attached. A power supply could 
                either be fully modular, semi modular, or non modular. If a PSU is fully modular, it means that 
                when you open up the box for the first time, all of the cables are going to be detached. So naturally, 
                semi modular means that only a couple are pre attached, and non modular means that every cable is 
                already attached. When a cable comes pre attached, it cannot be removed.

            Fully Modular

            <div class="col-sm-8 bg-white">
                So why buy a fully modular power supply? The reason for this is because you’re not always going 
                to have as many parts as the power supply supports. For example, most power supplies come with 2 
                SATA cables for storage devices, but you might only be installing one hard drive. For this situation, 
                you wouldn’t want both cables pre-attached, because this would likely cause a lot of cable clutter 
                down the line, which can be confusing when trying to sort out what cable is going where.

            <div class="col-sm-8 bg-white">
                A semi modular power supply only has the motherboard and CPU cables pre-attached. This is never 
                an issue, since those cables are necessary 100% of the time. All other cables come separated from 
                the supply itself, and can easily be attached using a chart that is provided in the box. It is also 
                the most frequently bought variant.

            <div class="col-sm-8 bg-white">
                A non modular (more often just called modular) power supply is a good buy for someone who has a big case and may not care about 
                a few excess cables here and there, because it won't cause any crowding issues. The other instance 
                that someone may need one is if they knew they would be needing every cable, whether it be the time 
                they build it, or in the foreseeable future. This option tends to be a little cheaper than the other 
                two, so if you feel like you’re someone who could have no problems with purchasing one, it’s a great 
                way to save a couple bucks.

                        SATA cables are for your storage devices that don't connect directly to the motherboard.
                        Molex cables are for the case fans. A SATA 3.3 cable is a special storage cable
                        that only some brands require. However, most do not. The AC cable is what connects your power
                        supply into your wall, giving power to the whole system.

                        really have to worry about wattage to begin with. Most of the time, just make sure

                        which says it's an "80 Plus Gold", all it's saying that its a better version that its
                        original.

                        brands. That doesn't mean that all other brands are bad, because new companies come out
                        with products every year. But those have been the most solid brands over the last few years.

                        of the case, and right under it will be the cooler, allowing little room to squeeze your hand 
                        through. This can be where a fully modular power supply comes in handy, because you’ll never have 
                        to worry about cables being a hassle to install.
