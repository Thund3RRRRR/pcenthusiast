                The graphics card is the most well known part of a PC, and is the most key part for anybody 
                that plays video games. They affect how clear the images on the screen are, and how fast and 
                smoothly the FPS (or frames per second) update. Similar to CPUs, there are 2 main brands for 
                these graphics cards, or GPUs: AMD and Nvidia. If hearing the name AMD rings a bell, it’s 
                because they’re also the company that makes the Ryzen CPUs. In the case of graphics cards, 
                the only advantage to having both components from AMD is that updating drivers will be a little 
                easier, because you’re not keeping track of two different brands.

            How Do I Know The Strength?

                To know the strength of a graphics card, the simple rule is that the bigger the number the better. 
                When you hear people talk about Nvidia cards, the brand is always an RTX card. The series is the first 
                two numbers, and the last two numbers are the model. Usually, there is a 60, 70, 80, and 90, in order 
                of least to most powerful. In the case of the 30 series, there was a 3060, 3070, etc. Some cards will 
                say they are “Super”, or “TI”, which in other words is the deluxe version of the original card. TI is 
                usually more powerful.

                A very important thing to note about the GPU market is that it is never stable. You may be familiar 
                with what happened in 2020 and 2021, upon the initial release of the RTX 3000 series. Cards can be bought 
                in bulk on release, and then resold for insane prices. Your best bet to get a graphics card is to wait 
                for a good deal from someone, wait for the market to relax, or miraculously be able to get one during a restock.
