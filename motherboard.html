                If your computer was a town, the motherboard would be the town plaza. What this means is
                every part of the computer is eventually going to have something connecting back to the
                motherboard. This allows for communication between the components, and the ability to get
                power where it needs to be at all times. There are a few things to consider when deciding what
                motherboard to buy. The first is size. For example, if you are trying to make a smaller and less expensive computer,
                buy a motherboard that will fit with your case, which will also be small. Whereas if you're
                building a more powerful computer, you would probably want to buy a bigger and nicer motherboard, which as a bonus,
                allows for upgrades of other components down the line. It's also very important to note that
                not all motherboards are compatable with all other brands of other components. Most motherboards only work
                with AMD or Intel, not both. Some can't fit in smaller cases, while others might not be able to
                support the storage you want. You should be prepared for potential problems with compatability, and
                should make sure that the parts you're choosing are flexable, so if there's a case where you might
                need to select a different storage drive, or a slightly different cooler, it's not a huge problem. 
                Often times, the description of the product will contain all of the information regarding 
                compatability, but you can always double check with google or <a href="pcpartpicker.com" target="_blank">pcpartpicker.com</a>.
