                If your computer was a town, the motherboard would be the town plaza. What this means is
                every part of the computer is eventually going to have something connecting back to the
                motherboard. This allows for communication between the components, and the ability to get
                power where it needs to be at all times. There are a few things to consider when deciding what
                motherboard to buy. The first is size. For example, if you are trying to make a smaller and less expensive computer,
                buy a motherboard that will fit with your case, which will also be small. Whereas if you're
                building a more powerful computer, you would probably want to buy a bigger and nicer motherboard, which as a bonus,
                allows for upgrades of other components down the line. It's also very important to note that
                not all motherboards are compatable with all other brands of other components. Most motherboards only work
                with AMD or Intel, not both. Some can't fit in smaller cases, while others might not be able to
                support the storage you want. You should be prepared for potential problems with compatability, and
                should make sure that the parts you're choosing are flexable, so if there's a case where you might
                need to select a different storage drive, or a slightly different cooler, it's not a huge problem. 
                Often times, the description of the product will contain all of the information regarding 
                compatability, but you can always double check with google or <a href="pcpartpicker.com" target="_blank">pcpartpicker.com</a>.

                <tr>
                    <td>Mini-Itx (or M-ITX): This motherboard type is perfect for a smaller, more compact build. It has just
                the right amount of sockets and space to hold the necissary components for a quick, clean, $500-600 computer.
                    </td>

                    <td>
                    Usually about $120-180. The market for motherboards has its ups and downs, so sometimes prices will be above this
                margin. Waiting for Black Friday or other sales is one option, or finding sellers on ebay and newegg could work as long as
                you're careful.

                <tr>
                    <td>Micro-ATX (or M-ATX): This motherboard has all the capabilities of an ATX motherboard, except without a few of the
                    minor features that will helps conserve space. This motherboard type is great if you want to build a midrange PC, and 
                    dont plan to have many extra parts. The upgradability on this board is decent, except again, as long as you don't plan on
                    adding a ton of extra components down the line.

                    <td>
                        Usually about $150-225. Most commonly bought for an everyday gaming/work computer that needs to be able to connect
                        a few components, but not so much where an entire ATX board is necissary.
                    </td>

                <tr>
                    <td>
                        ATX: These motherboards will have all the slots you need for graphics cards, LED strips, RAM, storage, and everything you
                    could think of. The only thing to keep in mind is size, because with all of these extra functionalities, there will need to be
                    a good amount of room in your case for the motherboard. The motherboard support is almost always in the description if your case 
                    on the product page, so you can refer to that if you forget. Often times, these motherboards will have LED's of their own, which could
                    be a nice touch to your build. But remember, perks like these are often reflected in the price.
                    </td>

                    <td>
                        Could range anywhere from $190-450 depending on how many parts you're putting in your PC.
